Subject: [PATCH 38/50] printk: Atomic print in printk context on shutdown
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.7/older/patches-6.7-rt6.tar.xz

For nbcon consoles, normally the printing is handled by the
dedicated console printing threads. However, on shutdown the
printing threads may not get a chance to print the final
messages.

When shutting down or rebooting (system_state > SYSTEM_RUNNING),
perform atomic printing from the printk() caller context.
