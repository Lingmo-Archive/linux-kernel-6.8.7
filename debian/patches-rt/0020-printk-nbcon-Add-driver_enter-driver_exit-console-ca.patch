Subject: [PATCH 20/50] printk: nbcon: Add driver_enter/driver_exit console
 callbacks
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.7/older/patches-6.7-rt6.tar.xz

Console drivers need some mechanism to synchronize between "normal
driver activity" and console printing. For uart serial drivers it
is the port lock. Other types of console drivers (network,
graphics, USB) will need something as well.

Provide 2 new mandatory nbcon console callbacks (driver_enter and
driver_exit) to allow the consoles drivers to implement the
appropriate synchronization. The callbacks are also expected to
disable/enable migration.
