Subject: [PATCH 11/50] printk: ringbuffer: Consider committed as finalized in
 panic
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.7/older/patches-6.7-rt6.tar.xz

A descriptor in the committed state means the record does not yet
exist for the reader. However, for the panic CPU, committed
records should be handled as finalized records since they contain
message data in a consistent state and may contain additional
hints as to the cause of the panic.

Add an exception for records in the commit state to not be
considered non-existing when reading from the panic CPU.
